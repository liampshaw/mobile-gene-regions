This folder contains a version of the pipeline specifically for analysing the twelve-betalactamase focal genes, as shown in the paper. 

### Getting the input data

The input data files are large and so must first be downloaded from Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8208376](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8208376).

The compressed archive should then be extracted within `input` in this folder:

```
cd input
tar -xzvf betalactamase_dataset.tar.gz
```

###Â Running the pipeline

```
snakemake --cores 1 --configfile betalactamases_config.yaml -r prepare_DB run_pangraph calculate_distances make_plots
```

(may take some time. Note that it should be possible to specify more cores, but currently this isn't working due to some error with calling blast at one point - I hope to fix soon)

### Further analysis

The folder `analysis` contains downstream analysis to make the figures in the paper from the pipeline outputs.
