Here we offer a solution to the problem in the form of two phylogenies that are based on a protein structure alignment. In the first, structural alignments were used as a guide for aligning amino acid sequences and in the second, the average root mean square distances between the alpha carbons of the proteins were used to create a pairwise distance matrix from which a neighbor-joining phylogeny was created. From those phylogenies, we show that the Class A and Class D beta-lactamases are sister taxa and that the divergence of the Class C beta-lactamases pre-dated the divergence of the Class A and Class D beta-lactamases.},

CARD focuses on providing high-quality reference data and molecular sequences within a controlled vocabulary, the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), designed by the CARD biocuration team to integrate with software development efforts for resistome analysis and prediction, such as CARD's Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes \& Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants. Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.},

	abstract = {TEM-1 ฮฒ-lactamase is one of the most well-known antibiotic resistance determinants around. It confers resistance to penicillins and early cephalosporins and has shown an astonishing functional plasticity in response to the introduction of novel drugs derived from these antibiotics. Since its discovery in the 1960s, over 170 variants of TEM-1 โ with different amino acid sequences and often resistance phenotypes โ have been isolated in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Next to this well-documented โnaturalโ evolution, the in vitro evolution of TEM-1 has been the focus of attention of many experimental studies. In this review, we compare the natural and laboratory evolution of TEM-1 in order to address the question to what extent the evolution of antibiotic resistance can be repeated, and hence might have been predicted, under laboratory conditions. We also use the comparison to gain an insight into the adaptive relevance of hitherto uncharacterized substitutions present in clinical isolates and to predict substitutions not yet observed in nature. Based on new structural insights, we review what is known about substitutions in TEM-1 that contribute to the extension of its resistance phenotype. Finally, we address the clinical relevance of TEM alleles during the past decade, which has been dominated by the emergence of another ฮฒ-lactamase, CTX-M.},

	abstract = {Genus Pectobacterium bacteria include important agricultural pathogens. Pectobacterium versatile isolates contain a chromosome-borne beta-lactamase, PEC-1. This enzyme is the closest relative of TEM-1, a plasmid-borne beta-lactamase widespread in the Enterobacterales. We performed bioinformatics and phenotypic analyses to investigate the genetic and phenotypic features of PEC-1 and its frequency and ability to spread within genus Pectobacterium. We also compared the characteristics of PEC-1 and TEM-1 and evaluated the likelihood of transfer. We found that blaPEC-1 was present principally in a small number of genetic environments in P. versatile. Identical blaPEC-1 genetic environments were present in closely related species, consistent with the high frequency of genetic exchange within the genus Pectobacterium. Despite the similarities between PEC-1 and TEM-1, their genetic environments displayed no significant identity, suggesting an absence of recent transfer. Phenotypic analyses on clonal constructs revealed similar hydrolysis spectra. Our results suggest that P. versatile is the main reservoir of PEC-1, which seems to transfer to closely related species. The genetic distance between PEC-1 and TEM-1, and the lack of conserved elements in their genetic environments, suggest that any transfer that may have occurred must have taken place well before the antibiotic era. IMPORTANCE This study aimed to compare the chromosomal beta-lactamase from Pectobacterium versatile, PEC-1, with the well-known and globally distributed TEM-1 in terms of genetic and functional properties. Despite the similarities between the enzymes, we obtained no definitive proof of gene transfer for the emergence of blaPEC-1 from blaTEM-1. Indeed, given the limited degree of sequence identity and the absence of a common genetic environment, it seems unlikely that any transfer of this gene has occurred recently. However, although blaPEC-1 was found mostly in one specific clade of the P. versatile species, certain isolates from other closely related species, such as Pectobacterium brasiliense and Pectobacterium polaris, may also carry this gene inserted into common genetic environments. This observation suggests that genetic exchanges are frequent, accounting for the diffusion of blaPEC-1 between isolates from different Pectobacterium species and, potentially, to exogenous mobile genetic elements.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance (AMR) in bacteria is a major threat to public health, and one of the key elements in the spread and evolution of AMR in clinical pathogens is the transfer of conjugative plasmids. The drivers of AMR evolution have been extensively studied in vitro, but the evolution of plasmid-mediated AMR in vivo remains poorly explored. Here, we tracked the evolution of the clinically-relevant plasmid pOXA-48, which confers resistance to the last-resort antibiotics carbapenems, in a large collection of enterobacterial clones isolated from the gut of hospitalised patients. Combining genomic and experimental approaches, we first characterized plasmid diversity and the genotypic and phenotypic effects of multiple plasmid mutations on a common genetic background. Second, using cutting-edge genomic editing in wild-type multidrug resistant enterobacteria, we dissected three cases of within-patient plasmid-mediated AMR evolution. Our results revealed, for the first time, compensatory evolution of plasmid-associated fitness cost, as well as the evolution of enhanced plasmid-mediated AMR, in bacteria evolving within the gut of hospitalised patients. Crucially, we observed that the evolution of plasmid-mediated AMR in vivo involves a pivotal trade-off between resistance levels and bacterial fitness. This study highlights the need to develop new evolution-informed approaches to tackle plasmid-mediated AMR dissemination.},

Here, we set out to determine predictive features of ARG transfer among bacterial clades. We use a statistical framework to identify putative horizontally transferred ARGs and the groups of bacteria that disseminate them. We identify 152 gene exchange networks containing 22,963 bacterial genomes. Analysis of ARG-surrounding sequences identify genes encoding putative mobilisation elements such as transposases and integrases that may be involved in gene transfer between genomes. Certain ARGs appear to be frequently mobilised by different mobile genetic elements. We characterise the phylogenetic reach of these mobilisation elements to predict the potential future dissemination of known ARGs. Using a separate database with 472,798 genomes from Streptococcaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, we confirm 34 of 94 predicted mobilisations. We explore transfer barriers beyond mobilisation and show experimentally that physiological constraints of the host can explain why specific genes are largely confined to Gram-negative bacteria although their mobile elements support dissemination to Gram-positive bacteria. Our approach may potentially enable better risk assessment of future resistance gene dissemination.},

	abstract = {Rates of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria have increased precipitously over the past several decades, with far-reaching healthcare and societal costs. Recent evidence has established a link between antibiotic resistance genes in human pathogens and those found in non-pathogenic, commensal, and environmental organisms, prompting deeper investigation of natural and human-associated reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. Functional metagenomic selections, in which shotgun-cloned DNA fragments are selected for their ability to confer survival to an indicator host, have been increasingly applied to the characterization of many antibiotic resistance reservoirs. These experiments have demonstrated that antibiotic resistance genes are highly diverse and widely distributed, many times bearing little to no similarity to known sequences. Through unbiased selections for survival to antibiotic exposure, functional metagenomics can improve annotations by reducing the discovery of false-positive resistance and by allowing for the identification of previously unrecognizable resistance genes. In this review, we summarize the novel resistance functions uncovered using functional metagenomic investigations of natural and human-impacted resistance reservoirs. Examples of novel antibiotic resistance genes include those highly divergent from known sequences, those for which sequence is entirely unable to predict resistance function, bifunctional resistance genes, and those with unconventional, atypical resistance mechanisms. Overcoming antibiotic resistance in the clinic will require a better understanding of existing resistance reservoirs and the dissemination networks that govern horizontal gene exchange, informing best practices to limit the spread of resistance-conferring genes to human pathogens.},

To address this, we performed an in-depth genomic investigation of 149 clinical ESBL-like E. coli isolates from a tertiary care hospital.

Furthermore, we identify two potential examples of recent horizontal transfer of actinobacterial ARGs to proteobacterial pathogens. Based on this bioinformatic evidence, we propose and experimentally test a โcarry-backโ mechanism for the transfer, involving conjugative transfer of a carrier sequence from proteobacteria to actinobacteria, recombination of the carrier sequence with the actinobacterial ARG, followed by natural transformation of proteobacteria with the carrier-sandwiched ARG.

One way to curb the development of antibiotic resistance is to design drug combinations where the development of resistance against one drug leads to collateral sensitivity to the other drug. Here we study collateral sensitivity patterns of the globally distributed extended-spectrum ฮฒ-lactamase CTX-M-15, and find three non-synonymous mutations with increased resistance against mecillinam or piperacillinโtazobactam that simultaneously confer full susceptibility to several cephalosporin drugs. We show in vitro and in mice that a combination of mecillinam and cefotaxime eliminates both wild-type and resistant CTX-M-15. Our results indicate that mecillinam and cefotaxime in combination constrain resistance evolution of CTX-M-15, and illustrate how drug combinations can be rationally designed to limit the resistance evolution of horizontally transferred genes by exploiting collateral sensitivity patterns.},

The metallo-ฮฒ-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of VR-143/97, constructed in an Escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. Sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class B ฮฒ-lactamase that was named VIM-1. At the sequence level VIM-1 was rather divergent from the other class B enzymes (16.4 to 38.7\% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass B1 including the ฮฒ-lactamase II of Bacillus cereus (Bc-II), the Bacteroides fragilis CcrA, the Chryseobacterium meningosepticum BlaB, and the cassette-encoded IMP-1 enzymes. Among these, VIM-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to Bc-II. Similarly to blaIMP,blaVIM was also found to be carried on a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. TheblaVIM-containing integron was located on the chromosome of P. aeruginosa VR-143/97, and the metallo-ฮฒ-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable toE. coli by conjugation. Expression of the integron-borneblaVIM gene in E. coli resulted in a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of ฮฒ-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the VIM-1 enzyme.},

	abstract = {A clinical isolate of Serratia marcescens (TN9106) produced a metallo beta-lactamase (IMP-1) which conferred resistance to imipenem and broad-spectrum beta-lactams. The blaIMP gene providing imipenem resistance was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The IMP-1 was purified from E. coli HB101 that harbors pSMBNU24 carrying blaIMP, and its apparent molecular mass was calculated to be about 30 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kinetic studies of IMP-1 against various beta-lactams revealed that this enzyme hydrolyzes not only various broad-spectrum beta-lactams but also carbapenems. However, aztreonam was relatively stable against IMP-1. Although clavulanate or cloxacillin failed to inhibit IMP-1, Hg2+, Fe2+, or Cu2+ blocked the enzyme's activity. Moreover, the presence of EDTA in the reaction buffer resulted in a decrease in the enzyme's activity. Carbapenem resistance was not transferred from S. marcescens TN9106 to E. coli CSH2 by conjugation. A hybridization study confirmed that blaIMP was encoded on the chromosome of S. marcescens TN9106. By nucleotide sequencing analysis, blaIMP was found to encode a protein of 246 amino acid residues and was shown to have considerable homology to the metallo beta-lactamase genes of Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Aeromonas hydrophila. The G+C content of blaIMP was 39.4\%. Four consensus amino acid residues, His-95, His-97, Cys-176, and His-215, which form putative zinc ligands, were conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of IMP-1. By determination of the amino acid sequence at the N terminus of purified mature IMP-1, 18 amino acid residues were found to be processed from the N terminus of the premature enzyme as a signal peptide. These results clearly show that IMP-1 is an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase, of which the primary structure has been completely determined, that confers resistance to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.},

However, the conservation of this promoter and the vertical transmission of bla$_{\textrm{NDM}}$ genes by chromosomal integration have not been comprehensively analyzed. We retrieved the region containing the ORF of bla$_{\textrm{NDM-1}}$ (\&gt;95\% translated protein identity) and a region 120โbp upstream of the bla$_{\textrm{NDM-1}}$ start codon from the complete sequence data of Enterobacteriaceae plasmids (nโ=โ10,914) and chromosomes (nโ=โ4908) deposited in GenBank, and the 310 extracted bla$_{\textrm{NDM}}$ genes were analyzed by an in-silico approach. The results showed that most bla$_{\textrm{NDM}}$ genes (99.0\%) utilized the promoter, P$_{\textrm{ISAba125}}$. Interestingly, two bla$_{\textrm{NDM-1}}$ genes from the genus Citrobacter utilized the ISCR1-derived outward-oriented promoters P$_{\textrm{OUT}}$ (P$_{\textrm{ISCR1}}$). Furthermore, the insertion of ISAba125 and ISCR1 occurred upstream of the CCATATTT sequence, which is located upstream of the -10 box. We also confirmed that most of the bla$_{\textrm{NDM}}$ genes were disseminated by horizontal gene transfer of the plasmid, but 10 cases of the bla$_{\textrm{NDM}}$ genes were integrated into the chromosome via mobile genetic elements such as IS26, IS150, ISCR1, ICE, and Tn7-like elements. Thus, plasmid-mediated transmission of the P$_{\textrm{ISAba125}}$-bla$_{\textrm{NDM}}$ genes is predominant in Enterobacteriaceae.

The origin of the genes associated with this resistance is of significant importance to our understanding of the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance in pathogens. A growing body of evidence implicates environmental organisms as reservoirs of these resistance genes; however, the role of anthropogenic use of antibiotics in the emergence of these genes is controversial. We report a screen of a sample of the culturable microbiome of Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico, in a region of the cave that has been isolated for over 4 million years. We report that, like surface microbes, these bacteria were highly resistant to antibiotics; some strains were resistant to 14 different commercially available antibiotics. Resistance was detected to a wide range of structurally different antibiotics including daptomycin, an antibiotic of last resort in the treatment of drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Enzyme-mediated mechanisms of resistance were also discovered for natural and semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics via glycosylation and through a kinase-mediated phosphorylation mechanism. Sequencing of the genome of one of the resistant bacteria identified a macrolide kinase encoding gene and characterization of its product revealed it to be related to a known family of kinases circulating in modern drug resistant pathogens. The implications of this study are significant to our understanding of the prevalence of resistance, even in microbiomes isolated from human use of antibiotics. This supports a growing understanding that antibiotic resistance is natural, ancient, and hard wired in the microbial pangenome.},

	abstract = {To determine the prevalence and genotypes of beta-lactamases among clones of a metagenomic library from the cold-seep sediments of Edison seamount (10,000 years old), we performed pulse-field gel electrophoresis, antibiotic susceptibility testing, pI determination, and DNA sequencing analysis. Among the 8,823 clones of the library, thirty clones produced beta-lactamases and had high levels of genetic diversity. Consistent with minimum inhibitory concentration patterns, we found that five (16.7\%) of thirty clones produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. 837- and 259-bp fragments specific to blaTEM genes were amplified, as determined by banding patterns of PCR amplification with designed primers. TEM-1 was the most prevalent beta-lactamase and conferred resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, and cephalothin. TEM-116 had a spectrum that was extended to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam. The resistance levels conferred by the pre-antibiotic era alleles of TEM-type beta-lactamases were essentially the same as the resistance levels conferred by the TEM-type alleles which had been isolated from clinically resistant strains of bacteria of the antibiotic era. Our first report on TEM-type beta-lactamases of the pre-antibiotic era indicates that TEM-type beta-lactamases paint a picture in which most of the diversity of the enzymes may not be the result of recent evolution, but that of ancient evolution.},

Both activity and antibacterial spectrum of compounds structurally related to third generation parenteral cephalosporins (of the oximino class) were superior to established compounds. Activity against staphylococci was found to be highest for cefdinir, cefprozil and BAY 3522. Cefetamet, ceftibuten and cefixime demonstrate no clinically meaningful antistaphylococcal activity while the other compounds investigated demonstrate intermediate activity. The antibacterial spectrum was broadest for cefdinir and cefpodoxime. New oral cephalosporins are equally inactive as established compounds against Enterobacter spp., Morganella, Listeria, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp., methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., penicillin-resistant pneumococci and anaerobes. New extended broad-spectrum betalactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-6, TEM-7, SHV-2, SHV-3, SHV-4, SHV-5, CMY-1, CMY-2, and CTX-M) are active against the majority of oral cephalosporins. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefixime and cefdinir were stable against some of these enzymes even to a higher extent than parenteral cephalosporins. New oral cephalosporins should improve the therapeutic perspectives of oral cephalosporins due to their higher activity against pathogens marginally susceptible to established compounds (higher multiplicity of maximum plasma concentrations over MICs of the pathogens) and furthermore by including in their spectrum organisms resistant to established absorbable cephalosporins (e.g. Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Citrobacter spp., and Serratia spp.).},

    abstract = {Prokaryotes have numerous mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that mediate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between cells. These elements can be costly, even deadly, and cells use numerous defense systems to filter, control, or inactivate them. Recent studies have shown that prophages, conjugative elements, their parasites (phage satellites and mobilizable elements), and other poorly described MGEs encode defense systems homologous to those of bacteria. These constitute a significant fraction of the repertoire of cellular defense genes. As components of MGEs, these defense systems have presumably evolved to provide them, not the cell, adaptive functions. While the interests of the host and MGEs are aligned when they face a common threat such as an infection by a virulent phage, defensive functions carried by MGEs might also play more selfish roles to fend off other antagonistic MGEs or to ensure their maintenance in the cell. MGEs are eventually lost from the surviving host genomes by mutational processes and their defense systems can be co-opted when they provide an advantage to the cell. The abundance of defense systems in MGEs thus sheds new light on the role, effect, and fate of the so-called โcellular defense systems,โ whereby they are not only merely microbial defensive weapons in a 2-partner arms race, but also tools of intragenomic conflict between multiple genetic elements with divergent interests that shape cell fate and gene flow at the population level.},

	abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae ORI-1 was isolated in 1998 in France from a rectal swab of a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in Cayenne Hospital, Cayenne, French Guiana. This strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, pTK1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. The gene for GES-1 (Guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B, where this pI-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kDa molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to ceftazidime). GES-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase GN79 from Proteus mirabilis; with YENT, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from Yersinia enterocolitica; and with L-2, a chromosome-borne class A cephalosporinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36\% amino acid identity each). However, a dendrogram analysis showed that GES-1 clustered within a class A ESBL subgroup together with ESBLs VEB-1 and PER-1. Sequencing of a 7,098-bp DNA fragment from plasmid pTK1 revealed that the GES-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named In52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an intI1 gene possessing two putative promoters, P(1) and P(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an attI1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(GES-1), aac(6')Ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrXVb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA4), and aadA2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacEDelta1 and sulI. The bla(GES-1) and aadA2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. This work identified the second class A ESBL gene of a non-TEM, non-SHV series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.},

Although penicillinases in Staphylococcus aureus challenged the initial uses of penicillin, ฮฒ-lactamases are most important in Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in enteric and nonfermentative pathogens, where collectively they confer resistance to all ฮฒ-lactam-containing antibiotics. Critical ฮฒ-lactamases are those enzymes whose genes are encoded on mobile elements that are transferable among species. Major ฮฒ-lactamase families include plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum ฮฒ-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC cephalosporinases, and carbapenemases now appearing globally, with geographic preferences for specific variants. CTX-M enzymes include the most common ESBLs that are prevalent in all areas of the world. In contrast, KPC serine carbapenemases are present more frequently in the Americas, the Mediterranean countries, and China, whereas NDM metallo-ฮฒ-lactamases are more prevalent in the Indian subcontinent and Eastern Europe. As selective pressure from ฮฒ-lactam use continues, multiple ฮฒ-lactamases per organism are increasingly common, including pathogens carrying three different carbapenemase genes. These organisms may be spread throughout health care facilities as well as in the community, warranting close attention to increased infection control measures and stewardship of the ฮฒ-lactam-containing drugs in an effort to control selection of even more deleterious pathogens.},

Despite the central role they play in antibiotic resistance and modern biotechnology, our understanding of plasmidsโ natural ecology is limited. Recent experiments have shown that plasmids can spread even when they are a burden to the cell, suggesting that natural plasmids may exist as parasites. Here, we use mathematical modeling to explore the ecology of such parasitic plasmids. We first develop models of single plasmids and find that a plasmidโs population dynamics and optimal infection strategy are strongly determined by the plasmidโs HGT mechanism. We then analyze models of co-infecting plasmids and show that parasitic plasmids are prone to a โtragedy of the commonsโ in which runaway plasmid invasion severely reduces host fitness. We propose that this tragedy of the commons is averted by selection between competing populations and demonstrate this effect in a metapopulation model. We derive predicted distributions of unique plasmid types in genomesโcomparison to the distribution of plasmids in a collection of 17,725 genomes supports a model of parasitic plasmids with positive plasmidโplasmid interactions that ameliorate plasmid fitness costs or promote the invasion of new plasmids.},

Here, we show that phages and PICIs from Staphylococcus aureus can mediate intra- and inter-species plasmid transfer via generalised transduction, potentially contributing to non-transmissible plasmid spread in nature. Further, staphylococcal PICIs enhance plasmid packaging efficiency, and phages and PICIs exert selective pressures on plasmids via the physical capacity of their capsids, explaining the bimodal size distribution observed for non-conjugative plasmids. Our results highlight that transducing agents (phages, PICIs) have important roles in bacterial plasmid evolution and, potentially, in antimicrobial resistance transmission.},

	abstract = {The resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae BM4493, isolated in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to cefotaxime and aztreonam was due to production of a novel beta-lactamase, CTX-M-17. The bla(CTX-M-17) gene was borne by 7,086-bp plasmid pIP843, which was entirely sequenced and which was found to belong to the ColE1 family. The 876-bp bla(CTX-M-17) gene differed from bla(CTX-M-14) by 2 nucleotides, which led to the single amino acid substitution Glu289--{\textgreater}Lys. bla(CTX-M-17) was flanked upstream by an ISEcp1-like element and downstream by an insertion sequence (IS) IS903 variant designated IS903-C. The transcriptional start site of bla(CTX-M-17) was located 109 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon in the ISEcp1-like element, which also provided the promoter sequences. Plasmid pIP843, which was non-self-transferable and nonmobilizable, contained five open reading frames transcribed in the same orientation. Regions homologous to sequences coding for putative RNA II and RNA I transcripts, a rom gene, which is involved in initiation of replication, and a cer-like gene, which is responsible for the stability of ColE1-like plasmids, were identified. Consensus sequences for putative replication (oriV) and transfer (oriT) origins were present. Results of primer extension experiments indicated that ISEcp1 provides the promoter for expression of bla(CTX-M-17) and may contribute to dissemination of this gene.},

Colony hybridization with probes specific for tnpA and tnpR of Tn3, tnpA and tnpI of Tn21, aacA4, and IS15, and restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA indicated that the structural genes for the enzymes were always associated with intact or deleted variants of the Tn3 family. Four of the nine blaTEM variants, which account for 62\% of 222 isolates in a molecular epidemiological study, were associated with replicons indistinguishable from the epidemic Inc7-M plasmid pCFF04 that carries the blaTEM-3 gene. This suggests that mutant genes were selected from the same prototype plasmid carrying penicillinase genes blaTEM-1 or -2. A 6.6 kb DNA fragment of pCFF04 containing blaTEM-3 was characterized by amplification mapping and sequencing. The results obtained indicated that blaTEM-3 was present on a copy of Tn1 interrupted at the start codon of the transposase by a DNA sequence reminiscent of the inverted repeats of class II transposons. This partial Tn1 copy was in turn, inserted into the transposase gene of a Tn21-like transposon containing an integron expressing an aacA4 gene. The presence of an integron can account for the various assortments of aminoglycoside resistance genes found associated with blaTEM-3.},

The factors driving this dominance are largely unclear. This study began from a genomic epidemiology analysis and followed by multiple approaches to identify the potential mechanisms driving the successful spread of a dominant clone. 638 patients in a 50-bed ICU were screened. 171 (26.8\%) and 21 had CRKP from swabs and clinical specimens, respectively. Many (39.8\% of those with โฅ7-day ICU stay) acquired CRKP. After removing 18 unable to recover, 174 CRKP isolates were genome sequenced and belonged to six sequence types, with ST11 being the most prevalent (nโ=โ154, 88.5\%) and most (nโ=โ169, 97.1\%) carrying blaKPC-2. The 154 ST11 isolates belonged to 7 clones, with one (clone 1, KL64 capsular type) being dominant (nโ=โ130, 84.4\%). Clone 1 and the second-most common clone (clone 2, KL64, nโ=โ15, 9.7\%) emerged simultaneously, which was also detected by genome-based dating. Clone 1 exhibited decreased biofilm formation, shorter environment survival, and attenuated virulence. In murine gut, clone 1 outcompeted clone 2. Transcriptomic analysis showed significant upregulation of the ethanolamine operon in clone 1 when competing with clone 2. Clone 1 exhibited increased utilization of ethanolamine as a nitrogen source. This highlights that reduced virulence and enhanced ability to utilize ethanolamine may promote the success of nosocomial multidrug-resistant clones.},

While a plethora of genomic data reveals the long-term fate of diverging coding sequences and their cis-regulatory elements, little is known about the early dynamics around the duplication event itself. In microorganisms, selection for increased gene expression often drives the expansion of gene copy-number mutations, which serves as a crude adaptation, prior to divergence through refining point mutations. Using a simple synthetic genetic reporter system that can distinguish between copy-number and point mutations, we study their early and transient adaptive dynamics in real time in Escherichia coli. We find two qualitatively different routes of adaptation, depending on the level of functional improvement needed. In conditions of high gene expression demand, the two mutation types occur as a combination. However, under low gene expression demand, copy-number and point mutations are mutually exclusive; here, owing to their higher frequency, adaptation is dominated by copy-number mutations, in a process we term amplification hindrance. Ultimately, due to high reversal rates and pleiotropic cost, copy-number mutations may not only serve as a crude and transient adaptation, but also constrain sequence divergence over evolutionary time scales.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to all antibiotic classes has been found in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. The reported prevalence of these resistances vary, driven by within-host AMR evolution at the patient level, and between-host transmission at the hospital level. Without dense longitudinal sampling, pragmatic analysis of AMR dynamics at multiple levels using routine surveillance data is essential to inform control measures.
We explored S. aureus AMR diversity in 70,000 isolates from a UK paediatric hospital between 2000-2020, using electronic datasets containing multiple routinely collected isolates per patient with phenotypic antibiograms, hospitalisation information, and antibiotic consumption.
At the hospital-level, the proportion of isolates that were meticillin-resistant (MRSA) increased between 2014-2020 from 25 to 50\%, before sharply decreasing to 30\%, likely due to a change in inpatient demographics. Temporal trends in the proportion of isolates resistant to different antibiotics were often correlated in MRSA, but independent in meticillin-susceptible S. aureus. Ciprofloxacin resistance in MRSA decreased from 70\% to 40\% of tested isolates between 2007-2020, likely linked to a national policy to reduce fluoroquinolone usage in 2007. At the patient level, we identified frequent AMR diversity, with 4\% of patients ever positive for S. aureus simultaneously carrying, at some point, multiple isolates with different resistances. We detected changes over time in AMR diversity in 3\% of patients ever positive for S. aureus. These changes equally represented gain and loss of resistance.
Within this routinely collected dataset, we found that 65\% of changes in resistance within a patientโs S. aureus population could not be explained by antibiotic exposure or between-patient transmission of bacteria, suggesting that within-host evolution via frequent gain and loss of AMR genes may be responsible for these changing AMR profiles. Our study highlights the value of exploring existing routine surveillance data to determine underlying mechanisms of AMR. These insights may substantially improve our understanding of the importance of antibiotic exposure variation, and the success of single S. aureus clones.},

Incorporation of different chromosomal blaCTX-M related genes from different species of Kluyvera has derived in different CTX-M clusters. In silico analyses have shown that this event has occurred at least nine times; in CTX-M-1 cluster (3), CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-9 clusters (2 each), and CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-25 clusters (1 each). This has been mainly produced by the participation of genetic mobilization units such as insertion sequences (ISEcp1 or ISCR1) and the later incorporation in hierarchical structures associated with multifaceted genetic structures including complex class 1 integrons and transposons. The capture of these blaCTX-M genes from the environment by highly mobilizable structures could have been a random event. Moreover, after incorporation within these structures, ฮฒ-lactam selective force such as that exerted by cefotaxime and ceftazidime has fueled mutational events underscoring diversification of different clusters. Nevertheless, more variants of CTX-M enzymes, including those not inhibited by ฮฒ-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid (IR-CTX-M variants), only obtained under in in vitro experiments, are still waiting to emerge in the clinical setting. Penetration and the later global spread of CTX-M producing organisms have been produced with the participation of the so-called โepidemic resistance plasmidsโ often carried in multi-drug resistant and virulent high-risk clones. All these facts but also the incorporation and co-selection of emerging resistance determinants within CTX-M producing bacteria, such as those encoding carbapenemases, depict the currently complex pandemic scenario of multi-drug resistant isolates.},

Inside this transposon, blaCTX-M-19 was bracketed upstream and downstream by insertion sequences ISE cp1B and IS903D, respectively, and further downstream by a truncated gene encoding an outer membrane protein for iron transport. The single-copy ISEcp1B element was probably involved alone in the mobilization process that led to a 5-bp duplication at the target site of the transposed fragment. This mobilization event probably involved one inverted repeat of ISE cp1B and a second sequence farther away, resembling its second inverted repeat. Additionally, ISEcp1B provided โ35 and โ10 promoter sequences, contributing to the high-level expression of the blaCTX-M-19 gene. Southern blot analysis failed to identify a reservoir of ISEcp1-like sequences among a series of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species usually found in the skin and intestinal human floras. The ability of ISEcp1-like elements to mobilize and to promote the expression of ฮฒ-lactamase genes may explain, in part, the current spread of CTX-M-type enzymes worldwide.},

	abstract = {Class 1 integrons are widespread genetic elements that allow bacteria to capture and express gene cassettes that are usually promoterless. These integrons play a major role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. They typically consist of a gene (intI) encoding an integrase (that catalyzes the gene cassette movement by site-specific recombination), a recombination site (attI1), and a promoter (Pc) responsible for the expression of inserted gene cassettes. The Pc promoter can occasionally be combined with a second promoter designated P2, and several Pc variants with different strengths have been described, although their relative distribution is not known. The Pc promoter in class 1 integrons is located within the intI1 coding sequence. The Pc polymorphism affects the amino acid sequence of IntI1 and the effect of this feature on the integrase recombination activity has not previously been investigated. We therefore conducted an extensive in silico study of class 1 integron sequences in order to assess the distribution of Pc variants. We also measured these promoters' strength by means of transcriptional reporter gene fusion experiments and estimated the excision and integration activities of the different IntI1 variants. We found that there are currently 13 Pc variants, leading to 10 IntI1 variants, that have a highly uneven distribution. There are five main Pc-P2 combinations, corresponding to five promoter strengths, and three main integrases displaying similar integration activity but very different excision efficiency. Promoter strength correlates with integrase excision activity: the weaker the promoter, the stronger the integrase. The tight relationship between the aptitude of class 1 integrons to recombine cassettes and express gene cassettes may be a key to understanding the short-term evolution of integrons. Dissemination of integron-driven drug resistance is therefore more complex than previously thought.},

Analysis of the sequence of the amplification product showed that bla(T)-6 differed by two nucleotide substitutions from bla(T)-1, the gene encoding TEM-1 penicillinase in plasmid pBR322. The mutations led to the substitution of a lysine for a glutamic acid at position 102 and of a histidine for an arginine at position 162 of the unprocessed TEM-1 protein. The presence of a 116 bp DNA insert upstream from bla(T)-6 resulted in the creation of hybrid promoter P6 in which the -10 region was that of TEM-1 promoter P3 whereas the -35 canonical sequence TTGACA was provided by the right end of the insert. P6 was found to be 10 times more active than P3 and to confer higher levels of antibiotic resistance upon the host. Analysis of the sequence of the insert indicated that the 116 bp fragment is related to insertion sequence IS1 but differs from it by three internal deletions that removed regions encoding the transposase. The distribution of the IS1-like element in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was studied by the polymerase chain reaction and by DNA-DNA hybridization.

	abstract = {Strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, particularly those that are multiresistant, are an increasing major health care problem around the world. It is now abundantly clear that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are able to meet the evolutionary challenge of combating antimicrobial chemotherapy, often by acquiring preexisting resistance determinants from the bacterial gene pool. This is achieved through the concerted activities of mobile genetic elements able to move within or between DNA molecules, which include insertion sequences, transposons, and gene cassettes/integrons, and those that are able to transfer between bacterial cells, such as plasmids and integrative conjugative elements. Together these elements play a central role in facilitating horizontal genetic exchange and therefore promote the acquisition and spread of resistance genes. This review aims to outline the characteristics of the major types of mobile genetic elements involved in acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, focusing on the so-called ESKAPEE group of organisms (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli), which have become the most problematic hospital pathogens.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements (TE), small mobile genetic elements unable to exist independently of the host genome, were initially believed to be exclusively deleterious genomic parasites. However, it is now clear that they play an important role as bacterial mutagenic agents, enabling the host to adapt to new environmental challenges and to colonize new niches. This review focuses on the impact of insertion sequences (IS), arguably the smallest TE, on bacterial genome plasticity and concomitant adaptability of phenotypic traits, including resistance to antibacterial agents, virulence, pathogenicity and catabolism. The direct consequence of IS transposition is the insertion of one DNA sequence into another. This event can result in gene inactivation as well as in modulation of neighbouring gene expression. The latter is usually mediated by de-repression or by the introduction of a complete or partial promoter located within the element. Furthermore, transcription and transposition of IS are affected by host factors and in some cases by environmental signals offering the host an adaptive strategy and promoting genetic variability to withstand the environmental challenges.},
